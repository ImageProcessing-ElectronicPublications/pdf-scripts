"""Small program to assist with the automation of the steps listed in the
[Bad Blocks HOWTO][1] for reallocating damaged sectors of a hard drive
(after some unfortunate events).

[1]: http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/badblockhowto.html

Unfortunately, the method that I have so far is to use a pipe with programs
from the e2fsprogs package and parse its output, which is admittedly not a
robust solution to the problem.

Given the number (LBA) of a problematic sector on a disk, the number of
the first sector of the partition that contains the LBA, the sector size
of the disk and the block size of the filesystem, we try to determine if
there is any file that may be damaged, and, if there is, then what they are.

The number of the sector is usually found in a dmesg log or on the
output of SMART checking tools, like `skdump` or `smartctl`.

You can, after such an unfortunate event, decide what to do (Copy whatever
is left of the file with problems? Redownload it? Recover from backups?)
and, then, issue a write command specifically to that sector, so that you
can force a reallocation of the sector to some spare sectors that the drive
may have (hopefully, it has some) with:

    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda2 bs=4096 count=1 seek=<B>

where B is the block number returned by the function `problematic_block`.
Of course, adjust /dev/sda2 to the appropriate (raw) block device and the
block site (bs parameter to dd) with the block size of your filesystem.

The detection of the names of filesystems only work with ext2/3/4
filesystems (since we depend on debugfs to find the names of the potentially
damaged files).
